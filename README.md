# 📝 Data Preprocessing

## 📄 Description
This project involves preprocessing a dataset related to a specific task. The focus is on reading data from a CSV file, analyzing the data structure, checking for null values, and examining unique values in specific columns like `Age`. This preprocessing is essential for preparing data for further analysis or model training.

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Steps
The data preprocessing follows these key steps:
1. **Drop Useless Columns**: Removing columns that do not contribute to the analysis.
2. **Handling Missing Data**: Managing missing values through various techniques.
3. **Correction of Format**: Ensuring data types and formats are consistent.
4. **Dealing with Outliers**: Identifying and handling outliers to improve data quality.
5. **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing or standardizing data to maintain consistency.
6. **Encoding Categorical Data**: Converting categorical data to numerical values for model compatibility.
7. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to enhance model performance.
8. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reducing dimensionality while preserving important information.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis, `numpy` for numerical operations, and `sklearn` for preprocessing and PCA.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the `Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to load the dataset and perform initial preprocessing steps such as:
   - Loading and displaying the dataset.
   - Applying each of the preprocessing steps listed above in a structured manner.

## 💻 Running on Google Colab
To run this project on Google Colab:
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the `Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to Colab.
3. Follow the instructions in each cell to process and analyze the dataset.

## 📂 Files
- **Preprocessing.ipynb**: Contains code to load and preprocess the dataset from a CSV file, handling missing values, and inspecting data attributes.
